hi there, i'm so glad to be here. today i'm going to talk to you about a project that i started in the Fall, examining how students think about complex questions regarding natural selection & adaptation.

i don't think it would be controversial to say that biology education is important: can foster care&appreciation for the natural world, help to create empathetic&engaged citizens that value and understand how we are all connected, and bolster scientific&computational literacy... BUT...

briefly explain what we mean by conceptual understanding.... 
between classes: biology education is fractured, teaching each course sioled as if its a discipline all its own
why do these things matter?

## Evolutionary theory is the concept behind the raw data

--

Here, some points about how evolutionary theory is the _why_

Can you bring in Mayr and how biology has levels of explanation at this point?

???
Its the framework and narrative for the entire discipline.
But, ususally save it for its own class or half of an e+e class
Is it surprising that students have such a hard time integrating all this raw data to form a robust conceptual framework in biology?

Like teaching literature by having a class on letters, a class on words, a class on book binding, a class on sentences... and saving reading books for an elective class at the end of study.

BUT if we want to get to the summit that is understanding evolution there's a long path to traverse...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain2

???
first, we all need to speak the same words...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain3

???
then we need to use those words to understand basic individual-level biological processes like DNA replication... 

---
class: middle, bg_mountain4

???
now we can begin to talk about the environment and ecology...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain5

???
then, we must start thinking about randomness, probability, and timescale: what processes may yield over millions of years...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain6

???
now we are about ready to bring in evolutionary mechanisms, which conceptually bring their own challenges...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain7

???
we must learn to distinguish the pattern from the process that generates it...

---
class: middle, bg_mountain8

???
and finally, we must distinguish levels of causality, functional and evolutionary (not mentioning correlation/causation, another talk)
given these two final stages, i set out to answer some questions

chose natural selection and adaptation as a pattern/process based concept that students are generally familiar with: also, very powerful aspect of understanding evolution generally as evidenced by darwin coming up with his theory without understanding mechanisms of inheritance, pop gen, etc.

-formal cause ultimate-process (THE ANSWER WE WANT!): environmental heterogeneity + biological tradeoffs over large timescales

and what we were looking for in the students' responses is the FORMAL cause -- the ultimate process responsible, the full evolutionary history of the trait and organism

coded responses based on what level of explanation the student addressed in response (sometimes more than one)

## What happened?

Answers a mess: formal instruction is not helping!

Very few students getting formal cause: some even move away from formal after instruction!

Often pairing proximate processes with ultimate patterns

Talk about how research shows that we spend way too much time on proximate in classes, so this makes perfect sense.. and then in evolution classes we spend way too much time using EXAMPLES highlighting ultimate pattern
